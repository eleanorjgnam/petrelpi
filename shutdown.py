#"shutdown.py" script FOR Research article for submission to Methods in Ecology and Evolution. 
#Hereward et al., Raspberry Pi nest cameras – an affordable tool for remote behavioural and conservation monitoring of bird nests. 


# This script will wait for a button to be pressed and then shutdown
# the Raspberry Pi.
# The clicker is to be connected on pins 39 (GND) & 40 (GPIO 21)
